combine Utility.validate and Utility.inset

what is the simplest way to enter application state and return to any state?
    this includes data binding
    
maybe the component: reveal could work with state
    anything that reveals something else can define state
    and when you reveal, you also pass metadata/context
    
enhancement: pen drawings calls create instructions
    then the instructions do the drawing
    this will also allow path drawing animation

try to consolidate the components: scroll and drag to -> "Move.js"
    because the user is moving the viewport

need to be able to register new component types on Entity

if constrain is missing flex or width/height/extent, maybe insert flex or width/height/extent 

change sidebar layer to Drawer layer

for scrollable, the mask is actually moved within bounds

next up
    dialog blur
    header strip for messages
    shapes (animated)

idea: implement painters for list selection, list dividers, elevation shadow, ripples

create the layout for a message panel
be able to add a message panel programatically
add the basis for the other panels
add blur to the dialog
implement ripple with animated painters
consider how to make animation super simple
    use Broadcast to know when started, finished, cancelled (and direction)
    don't use tweening callbacks
    may need to tween postions and extents (widths/heights)
    just create a super simple tweening mechanism
    
get broadcast to work for specific components - and not just universal

focus more on inline menus, sidebars, messages, dialogs
    and less on overlays
    
might still want a master header and master footer for the content layer
    master header for example for announcements
    
when I slide in and out sidebar panels - I can add the panel offscreen
    slide the entire widened panel - and then reduce width
    
simple color math

dialog as: dialog, sheet, document

I ought to create a reveal panel
    menus could slide out from under headers
    messages could slide of from under footers
    sidebars could slide in from the sides

change properties to options
ensure that every component has defaults

my cascades and component will draw need to know the full (parent) path
    to be able to lookup context from parent (themes, etc)
    
commonality
    sliders & list scrolling both have bounds
        maybe switches too - is a toggle just a slider?
        maybe determinite progress bars come into play as well
        scrollbars too?
        carousel as well
        
    so : switch, scrollbar, carousel, progress bar, slider, list
        
    boundable?
    
idea: transition an inline card to a dialog card

why acn't I just attach a message to the top of the content?
why do I gace to frame things? do I need to add a new Panel just to frame new vertical/horizontal content?
