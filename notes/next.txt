use an expander (component?) to expand option primitives to objects

consider: text and images as a component
    but might need to allow multiple like painters and filters

change base elements to extend from the word Root
    e.g. component.Root

review: might be redrawing everything on each cycle
    look at Main- what's the difference between render and draw?

miller panels need to be contained in a stack,
    so if content is replaced, the original content can slide out or fade away
    but then the lower stack must be removed

use emitter "view-has entered" for markup showing

need revealers for miller, drawer, accordian, dialog, toolbar menu

need to tighten up arranger code again: for cases of flow, inherit, flex, fixed, etc

explore use of Proxy object for a simple, complete reactive UI
    already using Proxy to listen for simple options changes

change "reveal" to "morph"
this allows for morph.in and morph.out
which is better than reveal.in reveal.out or reveal.reveal & reveal.conceal
also consider just using tween: tween.in and tween.out
maybe just stick with reveal.in reveal.out

consider being able to fade in layout/arranger/extent changes (after reveal arrangement shifting)
    like what chrome will often do when resizing the window

example:
    for hidden panel
    shift pivot up 100
    increase extent to 100
    then tween pivot down for it and lower panels

when installing reveal on an entity
    need to cache it's normal extent and set it to fixed: 0
    
move responsive list item into Arrange list item

maybe reveal has do to with visibility tweening
a default reveal has no tweening
maybe reveal should be named as component "visible"

really need to use ticker here for scrolling
see also: https://www.npmjs.com/package/wheel-inertia

text: 'The concept is that miller panels reveal inline panels, buttons reveal dialogs, buttons reveal inline expandable content and menus, tabs reveal inline content regions. Reveal is a component like painters and arrangers.',
text: 'When an entity is added to a panel, how does it reveal itself? Does its alpha begin at zero? Does its pivot begin obscured and then slide out? Does its height begin at zero and then grow?',
text: 'More and more its looking like tween is the major factor to reveal. And maybe visible is the reality. And layout is going to',

aspects of a revealer? invoke, add, tween 
    can all revealer reverse their actions?

could text be a component of an entity?
could image be a component of an entity?

be able to drag the shapes (Drag component)

actually, the reveal component might be related to the invoke component

work on change padding for Chnage display

inertia (easeoutsine)
scrollbars (boundedness/bound component)

switch some grey backgrounds to white

implement shadow painter to simplify card layout extent inherit

be able to pass parameters (color, alpha) into hover

switch to PIXI v4

work on a writeup for PIXI github

use pivot animation for revealer, revealing miller panels and expandable content/menus

get padding working with text area

get flow and inherit extents working horizontally

idea: extent could be
    'inherit', or 'flex' 'flex2', 'flex3', 'flex4', (if flex)
    or numeric

in general, the arranger code, want to work with extent objects and not primitives

    extent : {
        kind : 'fixed',
        value : 100
    }
    extent : {
        fixed : 100
    }
    extent : 100
    extent : {
        kind : 'flex',
        value : 4
    }
    extent : {
        flex : 4
    }
    extent : {
        kind : 'inherited'
    }
    extent : {
        inherit : true
    }

scrolling needs to take into account: container padding

scrolling issue: if content is shorter that viewport
    scrolling jumps

buttons need hover behavior, buttons need press behavior

important: add some sort of hyperlink to the top header.

work on all matters and concerns of revealing

work on drag component
    work on drag + scroll component eventually

realize every reason to employ Object.assign combining

I could use a variant of Object.assign which retains history
    then components such as Invoker, Paint, Filter can individually combine their childen

issue: mouse interaction issue after scrolling
    example: scroll a list and the toolbar buttons stop working (are covered)
    example: an animating ripple of a list item can affect other riiples

if a list item is selected, change ripple color
    maybe use goodshow.Value

be able to transform a ripple into a selection

Selection needs to select Select and not Select selecting itself
    this may be helpful with zero selection
    this may be helpful with zero, one, and multiple selection
    think this is complete

when clicking on a message it actually needs to fade away
    but should really be clicking on "CLOSE"

for lists allow to click/tap and drag

issue: unable to re-select a prior selected item (complete)

use a proxy for selection colors? 

need to clip (mouse) interaction in addition to drawing

scrollbars don't need to be a child
    can be an overlay

distinction: entity alpha vs. painter alpha

still a problem with alpha being zero and not being detected

goodshow Card needs updating/modernization (complete)

investigate using Kefir/FRP for trait/enhancer processing

allow for enhancing in other controls besides Label
allow options for enhancers to be "provided" e.g. theming, font sizes

use some key bindings - particularly escape to exit from dialogs and drawers
    maybe back arrow as well for milling

be able to register additional component types on Graphics entity

if a component is declared with a primitive and not an object,
    convert to an object Graphics resolve

make a separate test page for arranger height determination
    
switch to pixi v4 (done)
ripples, hovers, and actions for toolbar buttons
hover effects for toolbar buttons
ripple painters actually need to paint above and not behind
handle omission of arranger property, children property, flex property (and so forth)
basic mousewheel scrolling with bounds and maybe even simple inertia easing and bounce
basic text editor overlay
deterministic layout height for text, images, containers - and for parent containers

move alignment from label into a component

reimplement fab using components
be able to show dialog, drawers, etc from buttons
implement selection component
paint shadows on each mill panel border to separate
at least display message toasts in snackbar if a buttons does nothing
master header
move primary layers into nested stacks (for blur)
more painters including shadow w/ elevation
fix message panel margins
fix message panel arranging when dismissing
consolidate arrangers (horizonal and vertical) (minor/major for padding/margins)
work on revealer consolidation for menus, drawers, tabs, dialogs, and miller panels
demo styling cascade hooks
very basic reactive UI (with diffsync)
separate the projects into subprojects
implement lazy providing of children (for when scrolling)
tween drawer animation
tween message animation
tween dialog animation

use revealers to help with state/history management

DONE...
