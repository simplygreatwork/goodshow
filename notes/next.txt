get padding working with text area

get flow and inherit extents working horizontally

idea: extent could be
    'inherit', or 'flex' 'flex2', 'flex3', 'flex4', (if flex)
    or numeric

in general, the arranger code, want to work with extent objects and not primitives

    extent : {
        kind : 'fixed',
        value : 100
    }
    extent : {
        fixed : 100
    }
    extent : 100
    extent : {
        kind : 'flex',
        value : 4
    }
    extent : {
        flex : 4
    }
    extent : {
        kind : 'inherited'
    }
    extent : {
        inherit : true
    }

scrolling needs to take into account: container padding

scrolling issue: if content is shorter that viewport
    scrolling jumps

buttons need hover behavior, buttons need press behavior

important: add some sort of hyperlink to the top header.

work on all matters and concerns of revealing

work on drag component
    work on drag + scroll component eventually

realize every reason to employ Object.assign combining

I could use a variant of Object.assign which retains history
    then components such as Invoker, Paint, Filter can individually combine their childen

issue: mouse interaction issue after scrolling
    example: scroll a list and the toolbar buttons stop working (are covered)
    example: an animating ripple of a list item can affect other riiples

if a list item is selected, change ripple color
    maybe use goodshow.Value

be able to transform a ripple into a selection

Selection needs to select Select and not Select selecting itself
    this may be helpful with zero selection
    this may be helpful with zero, one, and multiple selection
    think this is complete

when clicking on a message it actually needs to fade away
    but should really be clicking on "CLOSE"

for lists allow to click/tap and drag

issue: unable to re-select a prior selected item (complete)

use a proxy for selection colors? 

need to clip (mouse) interaction in addition to drawing

scrollbars don't need to be a child
    can be an overlay

distinction: entity alpha vs. painter alpha

still a problem with alpha being zero and not being detected

goodshow Card needs updating/modernization (complete)

investigate using Kefir/FRP for trait/enhancer processing

allow for enhancing in other controls besides Label
allow options for enhancers to be "provided" e.g. theming, font sizes

use some key bindings - particularly escape to exit from dialogs and drawers
    maybe back arrow as well for milling

be able to register additional component types on Graphics entity

if a component is declared with a primitive and not an object,
    convert to an object Graphics resolve

make a separate test page for arranger height determination
    
switch to pixi v4
ripples, hovers, and actions for toolbar buttons
hover effects for toolbar buttons
ripple painters actually need to paint above and not behind
handle omission of arranger property, children property, flex property (and so forth)
basic mousewheel scrolling with bounds and maybe even simple inertia easing and bounce
basic text editor overlay
deterministic layout height for text, images, containers - and for parent containers

move alignment from label into a component

reimplement fab using components
be able to show dialog, drawers, etc from buttons
implement selection component
paint shadows on each mill panel border to separate
at least display message toasts in snackbar if a buttons does nothing
master header
move primary layers into nested stacks (for blur)
more painters including shadow w/ elevation
fix message panel margins
fix message panel arranging when dismissing
consolidate arrangers (horizonal and vertical) (minor/major for padding/margins)
work on revealer consolidation for menus, drawers, tabs, dialogs, and miller panels
demo styling cascade hooks
very basic reactive UI (with diffsync)
separate the projects into subprojects
implement lazy providing of children (for when scrolling)
tween drawer animation
tween message animation
tween dialog animation

use revealers to help with state/history management

DONE...
