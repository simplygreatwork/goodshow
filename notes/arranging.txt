natural layout flow (deterministic) is currently missing from GoodShow
any entity (or container) needs to know it's prefered height
there needs to be a common interface to query preferred height among graphics, container, text, and image (sprite)

consider that I can alter the vertical layout - after the initial layout
   I can add a phase to run after the normal arranger
consider that panels can already have heights today
consider that I can begin with text first - and ignore images

consider using Object.valueOf for extent height/width querying/determination
I am already using Object.valueOf for foreground/background colors upon selection

the extent of a panel is determined by the extent of its children
use goodshow.Extent (Object.valueOf) to represent extent

if has flex, use flex to set height
if no flex, use extent object value
if height object value has no height, calculate from chidren

do I need to calculate before drawing anything?
   because children may increase of decrease the extent of the container
   
by default the extent of a container is computed from the extents of the children
the extent of the container can override the calculated extent of the children
but what if one of the childen is set to flex?

can't layout text height until the width is known
so maybe layout every Horizontal arranger first then Vertical next
